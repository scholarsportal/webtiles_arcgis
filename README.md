This is a stand-alone application to demonstrate how a Tile Map Service (TMS) generated using GDAL2Tiles can be displayed in an AcrGIS JavaScript API Web Map. 
It has been configured to accept a URL Parameter of "url" set to the path of a TMS. 
The OCUL Historical Topographic Map Digitization Project has been making its TMS's open to the public on the Ontario Library Research Cloud (OLRC) which can be used to test this application.
Here's a [link](https://static.scholarsportal.info/web-tiles-demo/?url=https://static.scholarsportal.info/web-tiles/HTDP25K030L13a_1969TIFF/) to  this application set to one of these historical TMSs.
